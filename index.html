  <h2>what is going on here?</h2>
  <p>
    the source being passed to the player on page load is a webm file from
    the old extension, meaning it has passed through the `mediaWriter` in the old
    extension which puts duration and other metadata at the start of the file
    so that it is seekable (...hope i'm getting that right).
  </p>
  <p>
    the file is statically hosted in this repo, but on page load, the page
    fetches the file in full, and converts a blob of the file to an objectURL.
    this matters because it's the technique we'd use if we tried to get "local
    playback" set up in the webapp. that the video below plays on page load shows
    that a webm blob in memory is seekable in videojs. so, provided we can get
    `mediaWriter` going in the new extension, there's no reason we can't get
    local playback going in the webapp.
  </p>
  <p>
    the "swap" button here simulates what might happen when the upload is done.
    pressing it during playback loads the dash manifest to a second player,
    seeks it to the right place, pauses the webm player, and plays the new one.
    there's a slight pause, but we could probably engineer this away-- or even just
    defer swapping out the source until the user pauses if they are playing the
    video at the time the upload/processing completes.
